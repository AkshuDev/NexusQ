**NexusQ** is a powerful Python framework designed to simplify the integration of quantum computing into classical applications. It provides a high-level abstraction layer, enabling developers to seamlessly build and execute hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.

**Key Features:**

* **Intuitive Quantum Circuit Construction:** Easily create and manipulate quantum circuits using a Pythonic API.
* **Local Quantum Simulation:** Simulate quantum circuits on your local machine for development and testing.
* **Hardware Abstraction:** Connect to various quantum hardware providers (AWS Braket, IBM Quantum, Google Cirq) with a unified interface.
* **Hybrid Algorithm Development:** Build complex hybrid algorithms by combining classical and quantum code.
* **Pre-built Quantum Algorithms:** Leverage a library of optimized quantum algorithms for optimization, machine learning, and cryptography.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Get started quickly with detailed documentation and examples.

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install nexusq

**OR**

```bash
pip install PheonixAppAPI
